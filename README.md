# VideoLengthChecker
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY HOURS YOUR COURSE IS GOING TO TAKE?

This is a simple python script which can check total video file length of multiple videos from a directory(folder).

Requirements:
You should have OpenCv library installed. 
To install it, go to your terminal(windows/linux) and run the following command.

pip install opencv-python

Some words for final_calculate.py code:

Calculate your total course length you have downloaded from torrent :p If you don't know how many hours it will take to watch all the videos -_- Just give the proper path of your course
after running the script :3

Install opencv library if you don't have it by typing and executing
pip install opencv-python
inside vscode terminal/windows cmd/linux terminal
